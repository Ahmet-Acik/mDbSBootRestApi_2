# Docker Spring Boot MongoDB Project


This project demonstrates the integration of a Spring Boot application with MongoDB, utilizing Docker for containerization. It's designed for developers looking to implement CRUD operations on a MongoDB database through a Spring Boot application.

## Description

The Docker Spring Boot MongoDB project provides a RESTful API for managing student entities. It includes operations for creating, reading, updating, and deleting student records in a MongoDB database. The project showcases the use of Spring Data MongoDB for repository management, Spring Web for RESTful services, and Docker for easy deployment and environment consistency.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- Java JDK 11 or higher
- Maven
- Docker
- MongoDB


### Installing

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ahmet-Acik/DockerSpringBootMongoDB.git
cd DockerSpringBootMongoDB
```
 ### Installing MongoDB if not installed, and how to start it to work with the project can follow these steps:

1. **Check if MongoDB is installed**: Provide a command or instructions to check if MongoDB is already installed on the user's system.

2. **Download MongoDB**: Include a link to the MongoDB official download page and instructions for selecting the correct version based on the user's operating system.

3. **Install MongoDB**: Offer step-by-step instructions for installing MongoDB. These instructions will vary based on the operating system.

4. **Start MongoDB**: Provide commands to start the MongoDB server on the user's machine.

5. **Verify MongoDB is running**: Suggest a command to check that MongoDB is running correctly.

6. **Connect the project to MongoDB**: Explain any steps needed to configure the project to connect to the local MongoDB instance, such as updating application properties with the correct database URI.

Here's how you could structure these updates in the `README.md` file:

## Installing and Running MongoDB Locally

If you do not have MongoDB installed on your system, follow these steps to download, install, and start MongoDB.

### Check if MongoDB is Installed

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
mongo --version
```

If MongoDB is installed, you should see the version information. If not, follow the steps below to install it.

### Download MongoDB

1. Visit the MongoDB official download page: [MongoDB Download Center](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
2. Select the version suitable for your operating system.
3. Download the installer or package.

### Install MongoDB

#### For Windows

- Run the MongoDB installer you downloaded.
- Follow the installation wizard steps.
- Add MongoDB's `bin` folder to your system's PATH environment variable.

#### For macOS

- You can use Homebrew to install MongoDB:

```bash
brew tap mongodb/brew
brew install mongodb-community
```

#### For Linux

- The installation steps can vary depending on your Linux distribution. Please follow the instructions on the MongoDB website for your specific distribution.

### Start MongoDB

#### For Windows

- Open Command Prompt as Administrator and run:

```bash
net start MongoDB
```

#### For macOS and Linux

- Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
brew services start mongodb-community
```

### Verify MongoDB is Running

- You can verify that MongoDB is running by connecting to the database server using the MongoDB shell:

```bash
mongo
```

### Connect the Project to MongoDB

- Ensure your project's `application.properties` or `application.yml` file is configured to connect to your local MongoDB instance. Typically, the default URI is:

```properties
spring.data.mongodb.uri=mongodb://localhost:27017/yourDatabaseName
```

Replace `yourDatabaseName` with the name of your database.

After MongoDB is set up and running, you can proceed with the project installation and execution steps as described in the previous sections.
```

This guide assumes a general approach to installing MongoDB and may need adjustments based on specific user environments or newer versions of MongoDB.
2. Build the project using Maven:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

3. For Docker TODO Run the Docker container:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### Executing program

After successfully building and running the Docker container, the Spring Boot application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.
